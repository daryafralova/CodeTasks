---Companies often perform salary analyses to ensure fair compensation practices. One useful analysis is to check if there are any employees earning more than their direct managers.

---As a HR Analyst, you're asked to identify all employees who earn more than their direct managers. The result should include the employee's ID and name.

SELECT 
  emp.employee_id AS employee_id,
  emp.name AS employee_name
FROM employee AS mgr
INNER JOIN employee AS emp
  ON mgr.employee_id = emp.manager_id
WHERE emp.salary > mgr.salary
